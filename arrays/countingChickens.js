/*Bob is a chicken sexer. His job is to sort baby chicks into a Male(M) and Female(F) piles. When bob can't guess can throw his hands up and declare it with a '?'.

Bob's bosses don't trust Bob's ability just yet, so they have paired him with an expert sexer. All of Bob's decisions will be checked against the experts choices to generate a correctness score.

Scoring Rules
When they agree, he gets 1 point.
When they disagree but one has said '?', he gets 0.5 points.
When they disagree completely, he gets 0 points.
